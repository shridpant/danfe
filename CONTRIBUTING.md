# Contributing to danfe

Welcome to `danfe` and thank you for considering contributing to this open source project! Your help makes this software accessible and up-to-date for our users.

Reading and conforming to these guidelines will help us make the contribution process simple and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing `danfe`. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issues, assessing changes and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code to and from our internal repository. We also use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the software, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

We also use GitHub Issues to track bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

### Pull Requests

PRs to `danfe` are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. Simply, fork `danfe` and create your branch from `master`, and start contributing!

In general, PRs should:

1. Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
2. Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
3. Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
4. Include documentation in the repo or on our wiki.
5. Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.
